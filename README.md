# ARC-like data

The [ARC Prize](https://arcprize.org/) dataset is several visual puzzles, saved as relatively few samples in some json files.

It'd be nice to have infinite data from many puzzles loaded in memory on the fly.

It'd also be nice if the data were in 1D, to allow for quicker experimentation and iteration.

Enter `arc-like`. Everything's currently in [`./puzzles.py`](./puzzles.py).

Please add a puzzle!
